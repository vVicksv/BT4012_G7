The fraud problem we are addressing in this project is the detection of fraudulent job postings through textual and meta-information of the jobs. 
Fraudulent job postings often lure applicants into scams, leading to identity theft and financial loss.
Employment scams cost workers about $2 billion in direct losses yearly and is especially harmful to individuals actively seeking employment.
